        <h2 class="text-center section-title">Ancient Times</h2>
        <div class="timeline-item">
            <p>Uttarakhand's history dates back to ancient times and is mentioned in several Hindu scriptures, including the Vedas and Puranas. The region has been a significant part of the mythological stories, being the land where the Pandavas from the Mahabharata spent a considerable time during their exile and where Lord Shiva is believed to have meditated.</p>
        </div>

        <h2 class="text-center section-title">Medieval Period</h2>
        <div class="timeline-item">
            <p>During the medieval period, the region was ruled by various dynasties, including the Katyuris (9th to 12th century) and the Chand dynasty (13th to 18th century). The Katyuris established their capital in Baijnath and built several temples, while the Chand rulers were known for their patronage of art and culture. The region also saw the influence of the Gurkhas in the early 19th century before coming under British control after the Anglo-Nepalese War.</p>

        <h2 class="text-center section-title">British Period</h2>
        <div class="timeline-item">
            <p>The British colonial period brought significant changes to Uttarakhand. The British developed several hill stations, such as Nainital, Mussoorie, and Almora, making them popular summer retreats. The construction of roads and railways during this period also improved connectivity and boosted tourism.</p>
        </div>

        <h2 class="text-center section-title">Post-Independence</h2>
        <div class="timeline-item">
            <p>After India gained independence in 1947, Uttarakhand continued to be part of the state of Uttar Pradesh. The demand for a separate state grew over the decades, culminating in the formation of Uttarakhand as a separate state on November 9, 2000. The new state comprised the Garhwal and Kumaon divisions.</p>
        </div>

        <h2 class="text-center section-title">Modern Era</h2>
        <div class="timeline-item">
            <p>Today, Uttarakhand is known for its natural beauty, spiritual significance, and cultural heritage. It is home to several important pilgrimage sites, including the Char Dham (Badrinath, Kedarnath, Gangotri, and Yamunotri), and is a hub for adventure tourism with activities like trekking, rafting, and skiing.</p>
